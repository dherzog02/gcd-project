#Description

##Summary

The data set "tidyData.txt" is the output from the final step in the "run_analysis.R" script. This script creates two variables in the global environment called filtData and tidyData. After running the script the "tidyData.txt" file is created with the following line of code:
write.table(tidyData, row.name = FALSE, file = "tidyData.txt")

filtData is the combined & filtered data set that is the result of the first four steps of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course project. A second data table is created called tidyData that meets the requirements of step 5.

The data can be read into R using the following, assuming that tidyData.txt has been downloaded into the working directory:
tidyCopy <- read.table(file = "tidyData.txt", header =  TRUE, colClasses = c("factor","factor","character","numeric"))

##Source of the data

The source of the data is from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set available through the Machine Learning Repository at the University of California, Irvine. The project is URL is <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>

The original data is available here: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

This data has already been through a number of transformations and calculations. Those calculations are described in detail in the "features_info.txt" and "README.txt" files located in the zip file. 

 

#Contents

##Columns

The tidyData.txt file uses the melted form of tidy data as described by Hadley Wickham's paper available at <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf>. The four columns in this data set are:

- Subject - One of thirty subjects numbers 1:30. The original script coerces this column to a Factor.
- Activity - One of six different activities: WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
- Measure - One of sixty-six different measures described below.
- Value - The numeric value for that measure. All measures were bounded within [-1,1] from the original data set.

The total number of rows in this data set if 11,880 (30 subjects * 6 activities * 66 measures).

##Measures:

###Description of names

The measures column contains 66 possible values summarized below. As in the original features_info.txt file, '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. 
- Prefix Letter: 
	-'t' indicates a "time domain" value
	-'f' indicates a "frequency domain" value
- Measurement type:
	-BodyAcc - Body Accelerometer
	-GravityAcc - Gravity Accelerometer
	-BodyGyro - Body Gyroscope
	-...Jerk - Indicates "Jerk" data calculated using the Body Accelerometer or Body Gyroscope with the angular velocity
	-...Mag - Indicates "Magnitude" values which were calculated using the "Euclidean norm"
- Calculation:
	+mean - Mean measurement 
	+std - Standard deviation measurement
- XYZ - Denotes that this measurement has 3-axial signals separated into three different measurements, one for each direction
- '-summarized' - This is appended to the names of the variables to distinguish these values from the values in the intermediate source table filtData
